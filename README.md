# Unscented Kalman Filtering-based Point Cloud Registration

Python implementation code of unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) for point set registration. This code is based on the MATLAB implementation of https://github.com/dacvm/unscentedkalmanfilter_registration. More details on the theory can be found in [1].
